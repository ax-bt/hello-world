I've created this account to take part in the community features hosted by GitHub.
GitHub's use of Markdown and Jekyl interests me. FreeBSD's migration from Subversion to Git marked an significant endorsement of the platform.

My subsequent exploration of the many facets of project development that GitHub supports has lead me to continue learning more. The implementation of Kanban through Projects is particularly useful. With many functions and features unknown to me, I appreciate that this organizing tool (Projects) is integrated into the object of my interest.
